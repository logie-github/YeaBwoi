 * The game's touch controls, split like most phone MMOs (the user's choice, warcraft/PLAN.md
 * "Controls"):
 *
 * - **Left half, swipe and hold:** walks, like a stick under the thumb (nothing drawn): up W,
 *   down S, left Q and right E (sideways steps), and the diagonals between them. It follows a
 *   thumb that goes further.
 * - **Right half, drag:** turns the camera and the character (the right button held down in the
 *   middle of the screen, so it never lands on the action bars or the map).
 * - **Anywhere:** tap = a click where the finger is, which talks to NPCs, loots and gathers where
 *   WoW's cursor offers it, and selects an enemy ([GestureOutput.tapAt]); double tap on an enemy
 *   = attack it, on the action bars = two presses, on the game's windows of items, talents and
 *   abilities = two clicks (a talent's first tap shows it, the second spends the point: the app's
 *   add-on), elsewhere = jump (Space) ([GestureOutput.doubleTapAt], done as the second finger
 *   lands, not when it lifts: the user's choice, for a quicker jump); hold still, then lift = a
 *   right click anywhere; hold, then move = the left button down where it was held, dragging
 *   an item or a movable frame with the finger.
 * - **On the spellbook, while it's open:** a finger that moves is the mouse with its left button
 *   down where it came, so a spell drags onto the action bars as on a PC; a tap clicks, a hold
 *   right-clicks ([GestureOutput.dragsAt]).
 * - **On the character creation screen:** a finger that moves, on either half, turns the character
 *   (the left button held on the middle of the screen, the mouse going sideways), and a hold
 *   presses nothing (B and M would go into the name box) ([GestureOutput.turnsModel]).
 * - **Two fingers together:** pinch = zoom (the mouse wheel); tap = target the nearest enemy
 *   (Tab); swipe up = chat, with the keyboard.
 * - **Three-finger tap:** the keyboard. **Four-finger tap:** the menu.
 *
 * Each finger counts on its own, so the left thumb can walk while the right one turns, and taps
 * with another finger still click. Two fingers that come down together (within [PAIR_MS]) are a
 * two-finger gesture until they show otherwise: a pinch, a swipe up, or each going its own way.
 *
 * Fed the touch screen's events in its pixels, with the time in milliseconds; [onHold] is called
 * by the screen [HOLD_MS] after a finger comes down, and [setSize] when its size changes.
