 * WoW's cursor says what a click would do: the plain arrow over the ground and the interface; a

 * the cursor where it lands (the game's cursor as the screen sees it, by its picture: [isSpecial]
 * takes a fingerprint of it) and, when it's one of those, clicks like a right click after the
 * left one ([confirms]).
 *
 * The arrow is learnt at the login screen, where it's the only cursor ([learnArrow]). If that
 * goes wrong (no cursor then, or another one in the world), the cursor most taps land on is the
 * plain one: taps mostly press buttons and walk the interface.
