/**
 * The app's own add-on, put into the client's `Interface/AddOns` before each start (and left out
 * of the add-on manager's list): it tells the touch controls where the spellbook is while it's
 * open, so a drag that starts on it drags a spell, as the mouse does on a PC; and where the
 * game's windows of items, talents and abilities are (the bags, the bank, the character pane, the
 * talents, the action bars), where a hold is a right click.
 *
 * An add-on can't reach the app directly, so it says it to the realm on the phone: an add-on
 * message (prefix `WowTouch`) whispered to the player itself, which the realm keeps for the app
 * instead of passing on (patches/azerothcore/0009, `files/run/interface`). It says it again only
 * when it changes: "drag <left> <bottom> <right> <top> hold <left> <bottom> <right> <top> ..." in
 * ten-thousandths of the screen from its bottom left (the spellbook inside its own edges; each
 * group of windows as one area: the bags, the bank, the character pane, the talents, the bars at
 * the bottom, the bars on the right), "-" for none.
 *
 * The mounts and companions pane (the character pane's Pet tab) drags too, so a mount or a
 * companion goes onto the action bars as a spell does.
 *
 * A right click on an action bar's button (a hold, from the app) takes its action off the bar, as
 * dragging it away does on a PC, and does nothing else.
 *
 * A talent's first tap shows what it does (its tooltip) and spends nothing; a second tap on it
 * straight after (a double tap: the app clicks twice on the game's windows) spends the point.
 *
 * On the Wrath Remix realm it also puts **Report Time Anomaly** in the game's menu, under Macros,
 * and on the toolbar's Help button (there are no game masters to ask): a window asks what went
 * wrong, in as many lines as it takes (up to 1000 letters; the player may write nothing), and asks
 * the realm for a report, in add-on messages to the player itself (prefix `WowRemix`: "report
 * <what they wrote>", a long one in pieces, each but the last "report+ <its words>"). The realm
 * writes the report (mod-wrath-remix, RemixReport.cpp) and the app sends it to GitHub
 * ([com.logie.warcraft.AnomalyReports]).
 *
 * And it darkens the screen for a moment of the story when the realm asks (a scene's fade to black,
 * Moratari's tent): the realm's add-on message to the player "fade <milliseconds> <words>" (prefix
 * `WowRemix`, mod-wrath-remix's RemixOutings.cpp). The dark comes up in a second or so, the words in
 * the middle of it, and it goes again as the time is up.
 *
 * The opening's curtain (mod-wrath-remix's RemixIntro.cpp): "curtain <milliseconds> <words>" makes
 * the screen dark at once (the words on it: where and when the next act is; " | " a new line) and
 * keeps it so until "lift <milliseconds>" fades it out over that long, or the time runs out. Behind
 * it the game loads the place the realm has just put the player in, which is choppy on a phone; the
 * add-on watches the frames and tells the realm "settled <milliseconds>" once they have run smoothly
 * for a while (no frame over a fifth of a second for a second and a half, two seconds in at least),
 * counted from the curtain or from entering the world, whichever came last. The realm lifts the
 * curtain then, and the act begins on a world that has finished appearing.
 *
 * Add-ons made for a PC's screen are fitted to the phone's: TomTom's arrow at the top of the screen,
 * in the middle (TomTom's own place for it is the middle of the screen, over the character), unless
 * the player has dragged it elsewhere; Immersion's quest and gossip choices and its talking box kept
 * on the screen (its choices sit 500 right of the middle, past a phone screen's edge).
