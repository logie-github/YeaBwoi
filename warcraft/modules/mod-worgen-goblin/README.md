# mod-worgen-goblin: the Worgen and Goblins in ChromieCraft's realm

The Worgen and Goblins of [mod-worgoblin](https://github.com/heyitsbench/mod-worgoblin) (the
AzerothCore module most realms use for them, AGPL-3.0, pinned in `warcraft/server-version.env`),
playable in the app's 3.3.5 ChromieCraft realm beside the allied races and the Skyborne (not on
Wrath Remix's realm: "Only chromie needs new races"):

| Race | Id | Side | Starts | Classes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Goblin | 9 | Horde | The Valley of Trials (with the Orcs and Trolls) | Warrior, Hunter, Rogue, Priest, Death Knight, Shaman, Mage, Warlock |
| Worgen | 12 | Alliance | Shadowglen (with the Night Elves) | Warrior, Hunter, Rogue, Priest, Death Knight, Mage, Warlock, Druid |

What they have is mod-worgoblin's: their models (Cataclysm's), looks, voices, names, starting gear
and action bars, racials (the Goblins' Best Deals Anywhere, Better Living Through Chemistry, Pack
Hobgoblin, Rocket Barrage, Rocket Jump, Time is Money; the Worgen's Darkflight, Viciousness,
Aberration, Flayer and Two Forms), their side's language, the quests of their start
race's zone opened to them, their death knights' quests at Ebon Hold and the Goblins' trike vendor
and riding trainer, and their character creation scenes (Gilneas's and Kezan's).

mod-worgoblin is built as it is (its scripts: the Goblins' discount and Rocket Barrage); this module
puts the rest in the way the app's realm needs.

## How mod-worgoblin goes in

mod-worgoblin's own way is to copy 30 whole tables of the game over the server's and into the game,
replace four of the game's interface files and the race icon sheet, and apply its SQL to every
realm. In the app that would undo the HD looks', the allied races' and the Skyborne's changes to the
same tables and screen, put text an editor damaged into the game (quotes doubled, line breaks lost:
2000 spell tooltips), and give Wrath Remix the races. So:

- **The game's tables** (`data/client/dbc`, made by `tools/build_data.py` from the game's own tables
  and mod-worgoblin's): only what mod-worgoblin really changes, put on top of the tables the game
  already has (the Skyborne's format: mod-skyborne's `SkyborneFiles.cpp`, `ApplyChanges`):
  - its rows of the two races (looks, hair, features, start outfits, names, voices, barber styles,
    the race rows 9 and 12), renumbered where an HD look or the other modules may have rows of their
    own (looks 880000 on, outfits, hair and voices 8800 on, names 80000 on, emotes 88000 on);
  - its other new rows (its models' and items' displays, sounds, spells, items, icons) at its ids;
  - the race bits it adds to the game's rows (the reputations, skills, abilities, talent trees), OR'd
    in, and the few numbers it changes in the game's spells (Skinning's for the Worgen's Flayer) and
    helmets (which hide the Worgen's ears); never its copy of the game's text;
  - of its character tables, only the Worgen's and Goblins' rows (its tables also carry another
    project's rows for other races);
  - first, the game's own creatures of races 9 and 12 (the goblins of Azeroth's ports and the fel
    orcs of Outland: their looks, hair, features, voices and race rows) moved to races 28 and 29, as
    the allied races and the Skyborne move theirs, so they look as they always have;
  - the numbers mod-worgoblin's Worgen leave out filled in the way the game's own tables do (features
    0 and 16 none, the women's hair style 0 none): the screen counts a slider's rows and asks for each
    number from 0 up, and a missing one is the look-up that crashed it (crash report #34).
- **The game's patch** (`src/WorgenGoblinPatch.cpp`): `Data/patch-U.MPQ`, made as ChromieCraft's
  world server starts (as its configuration is about to be read, before the allied races' patch-V,
  the Skyborne's patch-Z and Wrath Remix's patch-Y, which are made from the game with it in and so
  carry its rows), from the tables above, mod-worgoblin's models, textures, sounds and icons (laid out
  by `tools/package.py` as the server is packaged: they're the game's, never in this repository), and
  the character creation screen (below). Made again only when the client, this module or those files
  change (the stamp in `patch-U.MPQ.worgengoblin`). On Wrath Remix (`WorgenGoblin.Enable = 0`, set by
  ctl.sh) it's set aside as `patch-U.MPQ.aside` and put back for ChromieCraft.
  `WorgenGoblin.ClientPatch = 0` takes it out.
- **The character creation screen**: the game's own screen files stay (mod-worgoblin's are the game's
  with a few changes). `data/client/Interface/GlueXML/WorgenGoblinCreate.lua` and `.xml`, read after
  the game's and before the allied races' and the Skyborne's code: race buttons up to 18 (the others'
  code makes 16: with these two races there are 18), the Worgen's and Goblins' icons from a sheet of
  their own (`UI-CharacterCreate-Worgoblin` and `-WorgoblinRound`, cut out of mod-worgoblin's sheet:
  the game's sheet has no column left, the allied races and the Skyborne have its free ones), their
  scenes' music and lights; their texts (`WorgenGoblinStrings.lua`) from mod-worgoblin's
  GlueStrings.lua. The layout is the allied races' (each side's races in two columns).
- **The world server's tables** (`data/server/worgen_goblin_dbc.sql`, made by `tools/build_data.py`):
  the same changes for the tables the world server reads (their `*_dbc` tables), run by
  `src/WorgenGoblin.cpp` at every start of ChromieCraft's world server, after every module's SQL
  is in and before the tables are read: new rows put in, race bits OR'd into the rows there. The
  allied races' and the Skyborne's SQL write whole rows of the same reputation tables, so whichever
  went in last would otherwise take the others' races out; their reputation rows merge the same way
  now (`tools/build_data.py` in both; until 1.0.328 the Skyborne's took the allied races' standing
  out of 98 reputations, or the other way round, whichever was applied last). mod-worgoblin's own
  `*_dbc` SQL isn't used (it replaces whole rows, and leaves the start outfits out).
- **The rest of its SQL** (the races' starts, stats, gear, action bars, skills, racials' scripts, the
  quests opened to them, its death knights' quests, the trike vendor: `tools/package.py`) goes into
  this module's `data/sql/chromiecraft/world` as the server is packaged, which ctl.sh puts in
  ChromieCraft's world database's update list alone; mod-worgoblin's own `data/sql` isn't in the
  package. Its death knights' quests were written for an older core: the columns this core's tables
  haven't are taken out of them (quest_template's RewardBonusMoney; creature_template's models and
  scale, which go into creature_template_model, and its trainer and immunity columns), and
  creature's id1 is this core's id (build 1.0.328's server test stopped on them). Its optional
  class trainers (templates only) aren't used.
- Its message at every login ("This server is running the Worgoblin module") is off
  (`Announce.enable`, set by ctl.sh).

## How it's made

- **`tools/build_data.py STOCK_DBC_DIR WORGOBLIN_DIR CORE_DIR`**: the server's dbc folder (the game's
  own tables: the data.zip in `warcraft/server-data.env`), mod-worgoblin at the pinned commit and the
  core's source (the `*_dbc` tables' columns) → `data/client/dbc/*.txt` and
  `data/server/worgen_goblin_dbc.sql`. Committed; run again when the pin moves.
  `tools/dbc_types.json`: the 30 tables' fields for build 12340 (from WoWDBDefs).
- **`tools/package.py WORGOBLIN_DIR OUT`** (run by `scripts/package-azerothcore.sh`; the compile keeps
  mod-worgoblin's `data/patch` for it): its files for the game, its race texts and its SQL, into the
  package.

## The starting areas (Gilneas, Kezan and the Lost Isles)

The user: Gilneas's and Kezan's starting areas from Cataclysm, "a very faithful port that doesn't
overwrite the old 3.3.5 content", the two races started there and joined to Wrath's world after them;
"for any other character than worgen or goblin the world and quests and everything stay as is". Built
in stages (`warcraft/PLAN.md`), now all in: the app downloads their package and the realm has them on
(`WorgenGoblin.StartingAreas`, set on once by ctl.sh; nothing of it has been played on a phone):

- **Their maps**, from Cataclysm Classic's files (`tools/zones/common.py` names the build, from
  wago.tools), made for 3.3.5a by [wotlkconv](https://github.com/Bar3b0n3s/Converter) (the commit
  `warcraft/zones-version.env` pins): Gilneas (map 654), the Lost Isles with Kezan (648), and the maps
  whose terrain Cataclysm swaps into them as the story goes. 3.3.5a can't swap a map's terrain, so each
  swap is made a whole map of its own (its base's tiles where it has none: 638, Gilneas as it is until
  quest 14222, where the Worgen start; 655 and 656; 659 and 661 for the Lost Isles), the player to be
  moved between them as Cataclysm swaps them. Two things the converter leaves that 3.3.5a can't take
  are fixed after it: the empty tiles' flag in a map's tile list, and Cataclysm's liquid types 3.3.5a
  hasn't (made its own of the same kind). Their ids are free in 3.3.5a's tables, and kept.
- **Everything they place** (`tools/zones/files.py`): the models, buildings and textures, with
  everything those use, read from the files themselves; the world's textures at most 512 across (a
  32-bit game on a phone), the interface's as they are; their minimap pictures, world maps and their
  discovered parts, loading screens, music and ambience (Ogg Vorbis, as mod-worgoblin's own voices).
  `data/zones/files.tsv` lists them by Cataclysm Classic's file ids (never the files: those are the
  game's).
- **Their rows in the game's tables and the server's** (`tools/zones/build_world.py`, which runs
  `build_tables.py`,
  `data/zones/client/dbc`, `data/zones/server`): the maps, their 92 areas, lights (3.3.5a's own
  layout: its light positions, colour and number bands, checked on the lights both games have), the
  areas' music, intro music, ambience and sounds, the buildings' areas, the world maps and their
  discovered parts, the loading screens. Every row is a new one: a Cataclysm id that 3.3.5a or another
  of the realm's modules has for something else is given a new one (and what names it is renumbered);
  one of 3.3.5a's that's the same (the same sound files) is used as it is. Exploration bits past
  3.3.5a's 4096 get free ones.
- **The package** (`tools/zones/package.py`, `scripts/package-zones.sh`): the converted files, and the
  world server's data for the seven maps (AzerothCore's own map, vmap and mmap tools over a stand-in
  game of them), published by CI as the release `cata-zones-<hash>`. Files with the same bytes (a terrain
  swap's tiles that are its base's) are kept once and named under each path.
- **In the realm** (`src/WorgenGoblin.cpp`, `src/WorgenGoblinPatch.cpp`, `ctl.sh zones_data`), with
  the package installed (`files/zones`) and `WorgenGoblin.StartingAreas` on: the patch-U the realm
  makes has their files (only those the game hasn't: none of the game's own is replaced), their rows
  (after mod-worgoblin's) and their maps' lines in the game's minimap index; the world server's data
  has their maps (never in place of a file that's there); the world's tables have their rows; the two
  races' new characters start in Gilneas City and Kezan (death knights at Ebon Hold, as ever). No other
  race's character is let onto their maps (a game master's is). Off, or without the package: their
  rows go, and the two races start with the Night Elves and the Orcs as before.

- **Their creatures and objects** (`tools/zones/build_world.py`, from the Cataclysm Preservation
  Project's world: `The-Cataclysm-Preservation-Project/TrinityCore`, its full TDB with its updates
  since, in a local MariaDB as `cpp_world`, and AzerothCore's own as `ac_world`): the 601 kinds of
  creature and 277 of object on the two maps, 19162 creatures and 3007 objects (Gilneas's on each of
  its maps whose terrain they're seen with), their looks (Cataclysm's new ones as new rows of the
  game's tables and the server's, through the converter's own rules; 3.3.5a's own where it's the same
  model and textures), the factions (Gilneas, the Bilgewater Cartel), their paths, formations, texts,
  gossip and Cataclysm's 31 phases as 3.3.5a's phase mask's bits. All in ranges of their own
  (`zones_world.sql`: creatures', objects', texts' and menus' ids from 6000000, spawns from 10000000
  (under 0xFFFFFF, AzerothCore's limit for spawns),
  paths from 600000000), put in once (the world database's `app_zones` says which) and taken out
  whole with the areas off. Their clothes and weapons are item looks of their own (the converter's
  ItemDisplayInfo rules, run in-process: its command line can't read the tables those join from).
- **Their quests, items, spells and scripts' data** (the same tool): 270 quests, every one the
  Worgen's or the Goblins' alone; their items (Cataclysm's ids where they're free); their spells
  (Cataclysm's split tables made 3.3.5a's one row; 3.3.5a's own where it has the same spell; a new
  one never on an id the world's spell tables already name, as AzerothCore's own rows can); CPP's
  SmartAI, loot, vendors, trainers (the realm's own trainers of the same class or profession),
  graveyards (their places from TrinityCore's `world_safe_locs`: Cataclysm Classic's game hasn't
  them), area triggers and the areas' phase auras (`spell_area`, as quests are taken and done).
  What they name that isn't in yet (C++ scripts CPP has, vehicles, spell visuals) is listed in
  `data/zones/left-for-later.txt`.
- **Their vehicles** (`tools/zones/vehicles.py`): Gilneas's horses, the Forsaken's catapults and the
  rest (27 vehicles, 43 seats as new rows of the game's tables and the server's; a seat's fields as
  AzerothCore's own layout names them, WoWDBDefs leaving 3.3.5a's unnamed), who rides them and how
  a player gets on (`vehicle_template_accessory`, `npc_spellclick_spells`).
- **CPP's scripts of Gilneas** (`src/WorgenGoblinGilneas.cpp`, `.h`: CPP's chapters 1 and 2, made
  AzerothCore's, under CPP's own names: the evacuation, the worgen runts, Josiah Avery, Greymane's and
  Crowley's horses, the crows, the Forsaken's invasion and its camera flight, the abominations, the
  children, the catapults, the attack mastiffs, the drowning watchmen). The world keeps a creature's,
  object's, spell's or area trigger's script name when there's code for it (this module's or
  AzerothCore's own); what the scripts name (their `NPC_`, `SPELL_`, `QUEST_`, `PATH_`, `BROADCAST_`
  and `CINEMATIC_` constants) comes into the world with them, and `src/WorgenGoblinZonesIds.h`
  (written by the build, `tools/zones/scripts.py`) turns Cataclysm's ids into the realm's.
- **Their quests are their own**: a quest is ported when it's of the starting areas' zones or a
  creature or object standing on their maps gives it; another zone's quest a row names (Icecrown's,
  Azshara's, the way on to Orgrimmar's) isn't, and is listed in `left-for-later.txt`.
- **What 3.3.5a's server doesn't do** (`src/WorgenGoblinZones.cpp`): Gilneas's terrain swaps, the
  player taken to their own map of Gilneas (638 until Last Stand, 14222, is done, then 654, then 655
  once Leader of the Pack, 14386, is), on any teleport there and as either quest is handed in; and
  Cataclysm's spell effects 3.3.5a hasn't (`tools/zones/spells.py`, made dummies, each answered by
  its script in `spell_script_names`): the phases updated, the teleports with their places
  (`spell_target_position`), the two movies as their narration (Cataclysm Classic's game has the
  Worgen's and Goblins' movies' sound, not their pictures); and the quests whose objective is
  casting a spell (the 14 class quests' "practise on the training dummy": `CAST_CREDITS` in
  `src/WorgenGoblinZonesIds.h`), which 3.3.5a's quests haven't: the cast counts as a kill would.
  Where Cataclysm's spell is one a 3.3.5a character of the class hasn't at level 1, the class's
  starting spell takes its place, in the quest's texts too (`STAND_INS` in `tools/zones/quests.py`):
  Charge → Heroic Strike, Steady Shot → Auto Shot, Flash Heal → Lesser Heal, Arcane Missiles →
  Fireball, Rejuvenation → Healing Touch, Immolate → Shadow Bolt, Primal Strike → Lightning Bolt
  (Eviscerate as it is).
- Kezan's quests CPP left unscripted (`src/WorgenGoblinKezan.cpp`, after LegionCore 7.3.5's
  `kezan.cpp` and Cataclysm's spells; what the world needs for them that CPP hasn't is in
  `tools/zones/scripts.py`: the scripts' names, the vehicles, the Buccaneer's spell clicks, the
  spells' edits):
  - Rolling with my Homies: the keys summon the hot rod (Cataclysm's vehicle 467: a driver's seat
    and the passengers'); driven up to Izzy, Ace or Gobber, each gets in and counts. Hired Looters
    it runs into are knocked away, their Stolen Loot the player's (Robbing Hoods).
  - The Great Bank Heist: the vault's door seats the player at the vault, which calls for one of its
    five tools; the right one fills its bar a tenth (Cataclysm's own instructions on the screen), a
    wrong one, or none within 8 seconds, takes a tenth off. Full, it counts and gives the Personal
    Riches.
  - Necessary Roughness: clicking the Buccaneer on the field puts the player in one; eight sharks run
    at it, a few steps at a time, and each footbomb goes at the nearest (Cataclysm aims it with an arc
    and a cursor, which a phone hasn't). One reaching the Buccaneer ends the try.
  - Fourth and Goal: the Buccaneer again; the kick goes through the uprights and counts (Deathwing's
    flight over Kezan after it isn't here).
  - 447: the Gasbot Control Panel sends the Gasbot to the generator in the house, where it blows up
    and counts.
  The vehicles CPP has none for are inferred from Cataclysm's tables (SkyFireDB's 5.4.8 world has
  the hot rod's, a driver's seat alone; the rest by their seats and the vault's power bar), and the
  Buccaneer's place from SkyFireDB's spawn: none of it has been played.

- **The Lost Isles' and Gilneas's last chapter's phases**, which CPP hasn't (its creatures there stand
  in phases nothing gave a player): Cataclysm's own phase auras (Quest Phase 01 to 10 on the Lost
  Isles; Phase - Quest Zone-Specific 09 to 16 in Gilneas, after the 05 to 08 CPP has there) over the
  zone from the quest that leads into each phase taken until the one after it is rewarded
  (`tools/zones/quests.py`, `LOST_ISLES_PHASES`, `GILNEAS_PHASES`): the goblins' camp moving on from
  Shipwreck Shore to the Savage Glen, the ship, Town-In-A-Box, the volcano, the labor mine and the
  Slave Pits; Gilneas's Greymane Manor, Stormglen and Tal'doren, the battle for the city, the
  Headlands. The windows are read from where each phase's quest givers and enders stand; Cataclysm's
  own conditions for them aren't in any source this environment can reach.
- **The Lost Isles' and Gilneas's last chapter's unscripted quests** (`src/WorgenGoblinLostIsles.cpp`,
  after LegionCore's `lost_isles.cpp`; `src/WorgenGoblinGilneasEnd.cpp`), with Cataclysm's spells. CPP
  has next to none of the Lost Isles' vehicles, paths or scripts; where Cataclysm used a vehicle or a
  flight nobody's data has, the quest keeps its objective more simply, at the user's word ("if it's not
  crucial to the quest you can skip it or change it"):
  - the escape pods (a survivor let out of each), the monkeys' bananas, the Frightened Miner (to the
    four nearest seams of ore), the KTC Snapflash, Thrall below deck, the fireworks on the Wild
    Cluckers, the pool pony's hatchlings, the Faceless of the Deep, the B.C. Eliminator (its cannon at
    the nearest Oomlot Warrior), the rocket boots (a minute of zombies run into), the Bootzooka (a fifth
    of Volcanoth's health a shot), the soulstone thrown down; Free the Captives and Repel the
    Paratroopers by kill credit;
  - Warchief's Revenge: the Cyclone of the Elements comes along and strikes the sailors about the
    player down, then takes them to the Wild Overlook; Up, Up & Away! and the Wild Mine Cart Ride: the
    flight's end (the landing site, the end of the line) on taking them;
  - Gilneas: the mountain horses follow the player to Lorna; a crash survivor reached is set on by the
    crocolisk the quest counts; Belysra's Talisman shows the Dark Scout; the battle for Gilneas City and
    the hunt for Sylvanas count on reaching where they end; a hippogryph mounted takes the gunship
    down.
  Seven of the zones' quests nothing gives (Cataclysm's own leftovers) stay as they are.
- **Their intros**: a new Worgen's first login shows Cataclysm's camera flight over Gilneas with the
  Worgen's narration, a Goblin's over Kezan with the Goblins' (ChrRaces 170 and 172: FlyByWorgen,
  FlyByGoblin, worgennarration.mp3, goblinnarration.mp3); without the areas, mod-worgoblin's Night Elf
  and Orc flights.
- **The Worgen's two forms** (`src/WorgenGoblinForms.cpp`, every Worgen, with the areas or without):
  in human form the game draws race 1 and the human model of their sex, the server keeping them race 12
  (quests, items, abilities and the saved character the Worgen's); their looks' numbers carry over
  (every one fits a human's range but the women's markings, shown as none and kept for every save).
  Two Forms (mod-worgoblin's racial, made Cataclysm's instant spell) turns them into the other form
  out of combat; entering combat or Darkflight turns them Worgen. In Gilneas the story sets it:
  human until Last Stand, Worgen until Last Chance at Humanity, which gives Two Forms. The barber's
  styles in human form are the Human's, which the server doesn't take for a Worgen: looks are changed
  in Worgen form. Whether the game redraws a character whose race changes while it's seen is for a
  phone to show.
- **The way into Wrath's world** (`src/WorgenGoblinZones.cpp`): Rut'theran Village turned in to Admiral
  Nightwind, the Worgen sail to Rut'theran Village, Darnassus their home; Warchief's Emissary taken, the
  Goblins are taken to Grommash Hold, Orgrimmar theirs, where 3.3.5a's own Thrall takes it (Cataclysm's
  Kor'kron Loyalist isn't in 3.3.5a's Orgrimmar; nothing new is spawned there).
- **In the app** (`ZonesPackage.kt`): with the realm set up and stopped, the app downloads the package
  this version names (`cata-zones-<hash>`: its size and SHA-256 built in, the download carried on after
  a dropped connection) into `files/zones`; the realm takes it in at its next start.

### Making the starting areas' data again

`tools/zones/build_world.py CACHE STOCK_DBC WOWDBDEFS LISTFILE CORE_DIR CONVERTER_SRC` (its docstring;
CONVERTER_SRC is the converter's `src` folder at the commit `warcraft/zones-version.env` pins),
with a local MariaDB holding the two worlds it reads:

- `cpp_world`: the Cataclysm Preservation Project's `TDB_full_world_434.22011_2022_01_09.sql` (its
  release) and then its `sql/updates/world/4.3.4/*.sql` in order;
- `ac_world`: the realm's core's `data/sql/base/db_world/*.sql` and then its
  `data/sql/updates/db_world/*.sql` in order.

It fetches what it needs of Cataclysm Classic's tables and files from wago.tools into CACHE, and
writes `data/zones`. The package is made from that by CI (`scripts/package-zones.sh`).

## Tests

- `tools/test_screen.py`: `WorgenGoblinCreate.lua` in Lua 5.1 against stand-ins for the game's
  screen, with the allied races' and the Skyborne's code after it, as the game loads them: 18 buttons,
  the Worgen's and Goblins' icons from their sheet and the others' from the game's as the sex and race
  change, their music and lights, each side's nine races in its two columns. CI runs it.
- `tools/test_patch.cpp`: the patch made for a stand-in game (the server's tables as the game's) and
  read back: the two races, the creatures moved to 28 and 29 (648 goblin and 130 fel orc looks), the
  race bits, the racials' spells, the game's own spell texts kept, the screen's files in its list, the
  icons, models and scenes, a second start keeping it; then the allied races' and the Skyborne's
  changes applied over its tables: every race there, none in another's place, no two looks with one
  id, Stormwind's reputation with the Worgen's, void elves' and High Order's bits. Built and run here.
- mod-allied-races' `tools/check_looks.py` on the tables as the game reads them (the game's, this
  patch's, the allied races' and the Skyborne's changes): the same problems as without this patch (36,
  on the server's plain tables: none of the Worgen's or Goblins'); before the gaps were filled, five
  of the Worgen's (features 0 and 16, the women's hair style 0). Run here.
- The world server's SQL against MariaDB 11.4 with the core's `*_dbc` tables and the allied races'
  and the Skyborne's SQL, in every order and each applied again: the same rows every time, every
  module's race bits in them. Run here.
- CI's server test: the patch made before the allied races' (30 tables), the rows in the world's
  tables, races 9 and 12 playable with their looks, the capitals' reputations with every race's bits,
  a Worgen and a Goblin warrior at their starts with their racials and their side's language; on
  Wrath Remix, the patch set aside and none of it in its world; back on ChromieCraft, the patch back.
  With the starting areas' package (the zones job's): their maps in the server's data with paths for
  each, their files in the patch, their seven maps and 92 areas in the world's tables, every script their
  rows name with its code, their spawns' ids under AzerothCore's limit (0xFFFFFF); a Worgen warrior
  starts on map 638 in Gilneas City and a Goblin warrior in Kezan (648), a Human and an Orc where they
  always have; the game's own creatures, objects, quests, items, scripts and other races' starts as
  they were; a Human put on Gilneas's map is taken home as it logs in; off again, their rows gone and
  the starts back.
- `tools/test_patch.cpp` with `WG_ZONE_TABLES`: a stand-in package's files in the patch, one the game
  has kept as the game's, one that's another's stored once under both names, the minimap index's
  lines, the seven maps and 92 areas added to the game's tables with the races' changes still in;
  without the package again, its files out. Built and run here.
- The starting areas' converter run here on all seven maps: AzerothCore's map_extractor takes all 241
  tiles, vmap4_extractor and vmap4_assembler the models and buildings, mmaps_generator the paths.
- Its SQL, as `tools/package.py` writes it, applied twice to a world database made from the pinned
  core's base and updates (MariaDB 11.4), with the allied races' and the Skyborne's: no error. Run
  here.
- Not tested: the game itself (the models drawn, the looks, the screen on a phone): nothing here
  runs the 3.3.5 client.
