--  * Where they go: after the screen lays out its races, each side's in two columns (the
--    Alliance's left, the Horde's right), two to a row from the top.
--  * Their icons: the blood elf's, blue and white-haired, in column 7 of the race icons (the patch
--    paints them there).
--  * Their backgrounds: the High Order's is the Humans' (they start in Northshire), the Windshapers'
--    the Tauren's (Camp Narache).
--  * Their text.
