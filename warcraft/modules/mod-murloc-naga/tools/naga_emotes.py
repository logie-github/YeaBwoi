"""Emotes for the naga players (and every naga that wears the race's model): the game's naga
character models (Character\\Naga_\\Male and Female) have stand, walk, run, swim, talk, work, roar,
the attacks and casts, wounds and death; no bow, wave, cheer, laugh, cry, salute, kneel, point, sit
or mount. As the world server makes the game's patch, src/MurlocNagaPatch.cpp (MergeEmotes) adds the
animations this makes to the client's own naga models (an HD look's, with one in), so that /bow,
/cheer... play, and a naga on a mount or sitting has a pose.

    python3 tools/naga_emotes.py fetch DIR          fetches the game's files from wago.tools by their ids
                                                     and writes DIR/Character/Naga_/<Sex>/Naga<Sex>Emotes.dat,
                                                     then DIR/nagaemotes.files (the list)
    python3 tools/naga_emotes.py convert SRC DIR    the same from files already fetched (named by id)

Where each animation comes from (today's files on wago.tools; never in this repository):
  - today's naga models (character/naga_/male/naga_male.m2 120294, female 120263: the same skeleton as
    the 3.3.5 naga's, its bones at the same places) have a few more than 3.3.5's: kneel (the emote,
    and its start, loop and end) and point. They're taken as they are, bone for bone.
  - Sitting and riding: the naga's tail coiled under it as it kneels (its kneel's start, loop and
    end), its upper body upright as it stands (sitting) or as the night elf rides (Mount: leaning on,
    the hands forward). Sleeping: the naga's own drowning (its collapse into a coil on the ground,
    lying, and that backwards to get up).
  - The rest no naga model has (checked: today's naga, the naga lord, the elite naga, the sea witch,
    the siren, Azshara's naga: talk, work, roar, kneel and point at most). The naga were night elves:
    the night elf models (character/nightelf/male/nightelfmale.m2 120791, female 120590, today's
    standalone ones) have every emote, and their upper body (the low spine, the chest, the neck, the
    head, the jaw, the arms from the shoulder to the wrist, the fingers the game names) is built as
    the naga's is. Each of those naga bones turns (in the world) from where it is as the naga stands
    as its night elf bone turns from where that is as the night elf stands; the female naga's four
    arms each as the night elf's arm on its side; the rest (the tail, the fins, the hair) held as the
    naga stands.

What's written: today's naga's skeleton (each bone's place, parent and key) and each bone's own keys
in each new sequence; the patch works out where each bone is in the world, finds the client model's
bone at each place and its own keys there (the client's skeleton's parents may differ: the 3.3.5
naga's tail bones all hang from one bone, today's from each other).

NagaXxxEmotes.dat: "NEMO", version 2 (u32), bone count, sequence count (u32); the bones (16 bytes:
place, 3 floats; parent, i16; key, i16); each sequence: its record as 3.3.5 has it (64 bytes: id,
variation, length, speed, flags with 0x20, frequency, replay, blend time; its bounds and the indices
after it the patch's), the id it's an alias of (u16, 0xFFFF for none: then no keys) and two bytes,
then for each bone its key count (u32) and keys (44 bytes): time (u32, ms), its own transform as a
move (3 floats), a turn (4 floats: x, y, z, w) and a scale (3 floats) (no pivot: the 4 x 4 those make
is the bone's transform from what it hangs from). A key is dropped where its neighbours' blend gives it
back (within a few tenths of a degree and two millimetres).
