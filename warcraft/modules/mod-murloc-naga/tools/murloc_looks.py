"""The murlocs' looks: what the character creation screen offers and what each choice is made of,
read by tools/murloc_model.py (the model and textures, from the game's files as the server is
packaged) and tools/build_data.py (the tables). Data only.

The model is Blizzard's newer murloc (creature/murloc2/murloc2.m2, file 1113034: the murlocs of
Cataclysm and after), made a character's. Its fins (the spines of its crest and back) are cut from
its body and drawn with the character's hair texture, so they take their own colour; its kin built
on the same skeleton (every bone of theirs at one of its bones' places, a few added) lend parts: the
classic murloc's crest (the murlocs of 2004), the deep sea murloc's sail, the shark-hooded murloc's outfit, Maria's hair
and dress (the murloc in a dress of the Darkmoon Faire), the demon hunter murloc's horns, blindfold
and loincloth, the deep sea murloc's lure.

The screen's choices (its labels set by data/client/Interface/GlueXML/MurlocNagaCreate.lua):
  - Skin Color: the body in each skin the game gives murloc2 and its re-skinned kin (13);
  - Eye Color (the game's Face): the eyes of each of those skins, and a few made from them;
  - Fins (the game's Hair Style): the crest as it is, short, long, swept back, the classic
    murloc's crest and the deep sea murloc's sail; each a geoset of group 0 (CharHairGeosets);
  - Fin Color (the game's Hair Color): the fins of each skin, and a few made from them;
  - Features (the game's Facial Hair): none, the demon horns, the lure, the blindfold, the shark
    outfit, the loincloth (and for women Maria's hair and dress); each a geoset of group 1
    (CharacterFacialHairStyles).

How the 3.3.5 game draws a character decides where each goes. The body and eyes are drawn with the
character's composed texture, in its face region (FaceUpper and FaceLower, 256 x 192 at the HD
looks' 512 scale): the only part of it no armour is drawn into, so a murloc's chest piece or boots
don't paint its scales. A face row (CharSections type 1: its eye colour and the skin colour) names
both of that region's textures: FaceLower, the body's lower part (a skin colour's); FaceUpper, the
eyes beside the body's upper part (an eye colour's and a skin colour's).
