-- The Murlocs and the Naga (mod-murloc-naga) on the character creation and selection screens. Loaded
-- after the game's own screens (the patch adds it to GlueXML.toc), before the other race modules'
-- screen code (their patches are read after this one):
--
--  * More race buttons: the game's screen has ten; MurlocNagaCreate.xml makes ten more, here given
--    the names the screen looks for (the others' code finds them there and leaves theirs unused).
--    Where they go is the allied races' and the Skyborne's code's (each side's races in two
--    columns, by the game's GetFactionForRace: the Murlocs the Alliance's, the Naga the Horde's).
--  * Their icons: the game's murloc head and murloc oracle, Warlord Kalithresh and Lady Vashj, on a
--    sheet of their own (UI-CharacterCreate-MurlocNaga and -MurlocNagaRound, made by the patch from
--    the game's icons), put on their buttons and by the race's name every frame the screen shows.
--  * Their backgrounds: a scene framed for their height. Murlocs stand as short as dwarves (the
--    Dwarves' scene); naga as tall as tauren (the Tauren's). On the selection screen, that scene's
--    music.
--  * Their text.
