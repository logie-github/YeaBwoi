-- Wrath Remix's prologue (STORY.md, "Prologue"): a new Timerunner, a veteran of the war against
-- the Lich King pulled out of a tavern in their own hour by Moratari, shown the war's end and its
-- cost (src/RemixIntro.cpp), arrives at the Infinite Bazaar in Crystalsong Forest, beneath
-- Dalaran, in the year the war began. Eternus tells them plainly what he wants and how it is done;
-- then, one thing at a time, Bronze and Alurmi, their class's instructor and lesson, the Bazaar's
-- keepers, the hourglass and the hearthstone, the anomalies; and the war's first day, in the
-- Borean Tundra. Each quest is given where the last one ended. WRM-nnn is quest 77nnn.
