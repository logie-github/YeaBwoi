-- Chapter II, The Wrathgate (STORY.md): the chapter the story turns on. Moratari's transitions
-- (the guide's bridges II-A, II-B and II-C) as Chapter I's are made
-- (wrath_remix_world_0006_bridges.sql), and between them the story: Wyrmrest Temple, where
-- Chromie has brought Sylvanas and Alleria Windrunner back from the future; Eternus's answer;
-- right before the Wrathgate's chain, his real plan, and the turn at the Bazaar; then a fight on
-- the cliffs above the gate, so that it happens as it did. Never the Wrathgate itself, nor the
-- Battle for the Undercity: II-B only follows the Wrathgate, and II-C the battle.

--   WRM-208  Alliance  Sylvanas to Alleria on the Wrathgate's cliffs: Eternus's loyalists; to

--   WRM-202  Alliance  after Return To Angrathar (12499)    by Alexstrasza, before Reborn From The Ashes
