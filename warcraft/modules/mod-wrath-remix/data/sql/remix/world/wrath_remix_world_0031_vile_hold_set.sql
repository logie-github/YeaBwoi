-- The Unrisen's plate: a death knight's set nobody mentions, in a Scourge coffer left by the supply
-- wagons on Malykriss's south terrace (up the spiked ramp from the crater floor's south edge, about
-- 170 yards on foot from the Great Hourglass), a spiked skull helm set on its lid. A click on the
-- coffer starts WRM-061 to 063 (src/RemixVileHoldSet.cpp): break the three binding runes around it,
-- have the Great Hourglass write the Timerunner's name on the runesmith's tally, kneel at the
-- coffer. The last gives the plate, in one container (one bag slot at the turn-in; what doesn't fit
-- stays in it until it's taken).
--
-- The plate is an heirloom any class can wear: armour subclass Miscellaneous (no proficiency; the
-- core's CanUseItem checks a skill only for cloth to shield), bind to account, level 1 and up,
-- scaled by ScalingStatDistribution (which stats) and ScalingStatValue (which of
-- ScalingStatValues.dbc's columns: the budget and the armour for the wearer's level, to 80). Only
-- rows and bits the game's own DBCs have, so the client's tooltips agree. 3.3.5's heirlooms cover
-- shoulders, chests, rings and weapons; the other slots borrow the nearest column (see README):
--   head    primary budget, plate shoulder armour     wrists  ring budget, mail shoulder armour
--   chest   primary budget, plate chest armour        hands   shoulder budget, mail chest armour
--   legs    primary budget, plate chest armour        waist   shoulder budget, mail chest armour
--   shoulders, feet: shoulder budget, plate shoulder armour; back: ring budget, cloak armour.
-- Stats every class uses: critical strike, hit and stamina (ScalingStatDistribution 371, the Dread
-- Pirate Ring's), haste on wrists, hands and feet (251, Swift Hand of Justice's).
-- The looks are the Acherus Knight's, a death knight's first plate (the only death knight set with
-- all eight armour slots and an icon for each).
--
-- Ids: items 77010 to 77020, game objects 770200 to 770206 (spawns 7705800 to 7705804), quests 77061
-- to 77063, npc_text 7702180. No creatures (the credits are game objects).

-- The plate, the container that holds it, and the tally.
