A scene is a list of steps, played for one Timerunner (RemixScenes.cpp): who is in it (people
summoned where the scene stands, or bound to the people already there), what they say (each line
is given time to be read: about 15 letters a second, at least four seconds), where they walk, what
they do. Positions are yards forward and to the left of the scene's anchor, as it faces; a facing
is added to the anchor's (pi: facing back the way it looks).
