"""Makes the Infinite Bazaar's Bronze vendors' lists from a world database.

Legion Remix's Bazaar sells, for Bronze, what its expansion was known for, each of its vendors
one trade: its raids' and dungeons' sets and gear by difficulty, its PvP and world apparel, its
mounts, companions and toys, its consumables, gems and materials. This does the same for Wrath of
the Lich King, each Legion Remix vendor selling the Wrath version of their wares. The world
database says what dropped where (instance_encounters and the bosses' loot, references followed,
and the chests the game puts its loot in) and who sells what (the PvP vendors, by what their
prices ask for; the Northrend factions' quartermasters); tier sets come from their item sets;
relics, glyphs and gems from item_template (those the game gives somehow: a vendor, loot, a
quest, or a spell that makes them); mounts, companions, toys, consumables, cosmetics, emblems
and materials from the lists below. It writes
data/sql/remix/world/wrath_remix_world_0010_vendors.sql (the price ladder as ItemExtendedCost
rows, the lists as hidden vendor templates and npc_vendor rows, and remix_vendor_list, which says
which Bazaar vendor offers which list) and data/vendor_catalog.md (what's on each list).

    python3 tools/vendor_catalog.py --mysql "mariadb -uroot acore_world" \\
        --dbc <the server's data>/dbc

--mysql is the command that runs SQL on stdin against the (unchanged, ChromieCraft) world
database and prints tab-separated rows (mariadb's batch output; the app's
"sh <files>/server/ctl.sh sql acore_world" does too); --dbc the folder with the client's DBC files
(DungeonEncounter.dbc, ItemSet.dbc, ItemExtendedCost.dbc, GemProperties.dbc,
SpellItemEnchantment.dbc, Spell.dbc).
