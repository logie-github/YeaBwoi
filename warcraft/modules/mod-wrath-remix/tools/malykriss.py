"""Writes Malykriss: The Vile Hold, the Infinite Bazaar's home: data/sql/remix/world/wrath_remix_world_0030_malykriss.sql.

    python3 tools/malykriss.py

Malykriss is the necropolis the Lich King began in Icecrown to replace Acherus and never finished: a
crater of saronite under the ribs of a necropolis with no skin, its walkways a hundred and twenty
yards up. The Bazaar stands on the crater's level floor (tools/bazaar.py). In Remix's world the
Scourge's garrison is gone (its spawns and the game's quests that need them: the Shadow Vault's
Malykriss quests), and the hall belongs to the Bazaar's allies:

  - the Knights of the Ebon Blade: their quarter in the east field (their commander, duelists,
    deathchargers, a runeforge), wardens at the west gate, runesmiths at the Scourge's Runeworks, a
    patrol on the floor and sentinels on the walkways and at the Icy Lookout;
  - the last free nerubians of Azjol-Nerub, who were building in saronite before the Scourge stole
    the craft from them: their hall in the north-west lobe by the Blood Forge (their warlord, an
    elder, an architect, silkweavers, eggs, burrows, spiderlings), a warden walking the floor, one
    on the north walkway, one at the Altar of Sacrifice, and skyguards circling the necropolis;
  - and the time-magic at the heart: the hourglass's sands heard and glowing, two sandshapers
    channelling bronze into it, a time rift above it pouring gold, frost spheres circling it
    (src/RemixMalykriss.cpp moves and casts them).

Those with something to say say it as the Bazaar's people do (remix_bazaar_line, src/RemixBazaar.cpp;
this file's spawns are 7706000 and up). Heights are the floor's: data/bazaar_ground.tsv (the camp)
and data/malykriss_ground.tsv (everywhere else here, both levels), `.remix ground` on the realm.
Positions are the world's (x north, y west).
