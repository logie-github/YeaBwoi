"""Moratari, if you like (STORY.md, "Moratari, if you like"; tools/story.py writes it): an optional line of
nine quests with her, from tea in the Borean Tundra to a promise in Icecrown, each opened by a
checkpoint in the main story, flirting first and something real after.

- Its dates are outings (RemixOutings.cpp): cider at a Dalaran inn (A Hero's Welcome for the
  Alliance, The Filthy Animal for the Horde), dinner at Krasus' Landing in her evening dress, the top
  of Wyrmrest Temple at night (where she shows the Timerunner her true shape), a flight on her back
  from Dalaran to Wyrmrest, and her tent at the Bazaar: private (a phase of its own), the
  Timerunner's gear unseen and hers set aside, the screen fading to black; afterwards their gear is
  seen again, she is at her post, and they are back where they were.
- An afternoon of their own in Sholazar (three crocolisks evicted, a blanket by the river), and a
  promise at the edge of the camp in Icecrown.
- After the tent she walks with the Timerunner everywhere, until they go home (Back to Your Own
  Time). On ChromieCraft, her letter is waiting in the mail; Chromie brings it (RemixEnding.cpp).

It stays PG-13 and in Warcraft's voice: flirting, kisses, a fade to black. Her words are the same for
every Timerunner, whatever their sex; now and then she says something about their race. She is of the
Infinite Dragonflight, as the story has her; her true shape is the bronze she was before it.
