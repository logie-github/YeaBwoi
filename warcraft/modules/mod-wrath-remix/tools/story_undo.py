"""After the turn: putting back what the record cannot keep (STORY.md, "Moratari in the war"; tools/story.py
writes it).

The future Sylvanas has told the Timerunner the war must happen as it did, and at the turn Moratari
learned what Eternus left out. She asks the Timerunner to help her put back what they changed
together, without taking back a single life:

- WRM-048 Lost at Sea: William Allerton, alive and asking questions about Unit S, sails home under
  another name; the ledger keeps him dead at Farshire.
- WRM-049 Forged Orders: Unit S's freed men and Hammerhill's volunteers are sent home to Stormwind's
  harbor; the record keeps Unit S lost at the landing.
- WRM-230 The Record Keeps Warsong: after the Wrathgate, the coast's garrison, the spare tanks and the
  plains' wounded go back to Orgrimmar under the Warchief's martial law; and Garrosh's lesson breaks
  at his friend's son's armour.

Wintergarde's company at Fordragon Hold is recalled by the High Commander himself (WRM-201's text, in
wrath_remix_world_0011_chapter2.sql); the word sent to Saurfang never reaches his son (Agmar burned
it: a whisper in story_dragonblight.py). After Angrathar, the end of Chapter II, waits for those of
these that put back something the Timerunner changed.
