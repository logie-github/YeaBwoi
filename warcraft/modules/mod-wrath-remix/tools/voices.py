"""Moratari's own voice: her lines as Legion Remix has them (Moratari, 241140; the game's files
sound/creature/moratari/vo_1125_moratari_NN_f.ogg), the ones that fit Wrath Remix, each with the
moment the realm speaks it at.

    python3 tools/voices.py              writes data/sql/remix/world/wrath_remix_world_0028_voices.sql
    python3 tools/voices.py fetch DIR    puts each line's sound in DIR as a WAV (the game's own voices'
                                         format): from wago.tools by its file id, through ffmpeg

The sounds are the game's files, so they are never in this repository: the server package fetches
them (scripts/package-azerothcore.sh) into the module's data/voices, where the world server finds
them (ClientPatch.cpp puts them in the game's patch with their SoundEntries rows; RemixVoices.cpp
plays them as she says the words). Without them she speaks in text alone.

The words are what she says in each file (heard: the game's text for them isn't in its tables).
