"""Writes the Infinite Bazaar's camp: data/sql/remix/world/wrath_remix_world_0023_bazaar.sql.

    python3 tools/bazaar.py

The Bazaar is a camp in Malykriss: The Vile Hold, the necropolis the Lich King began in Icecrown and never
finished (until build 117 it stood in Crystalsong Forest; every spot moved by the same step, x + 694 and
y + 854, onto the level floor under the necropolis's ribs). It is a camp, not a ring of people. Around the story's own people at its heart (Eternus,
Moratari, the echoes; wrath_remix_world_0004_spawns.sql and the others place them, and the turn's
scene walks between them), it has districts a Timerunner can read at a glance:

  - the heart, under a great hourglass, where every Timerunner wakes; Pageturner Metros's desk;
  - the market lane along the west edge: a stall for each Bronze trader, Alurmi's first;
  - the north row along the north edge, facing the heart: the heroic raids' pavilions (Pythagorus,
    Sacerdormu), the apparel stalls (Agos, Unicus, Larah, Freddie), Nedward's barber's chair;
  - the training yard to the south-east: the instructors at work, dummies and targets to try;
    Grandmaster Jakkus's stall and Momentus the weaponmaster at its east edge;
  - the waystation to the north-east: Zephyr, her drake and a door in time; Sa'at's map table;
    Hemet Nesingwary's mounts and proto-drake;
  - the chronicle corner to the north-west: the Chronologist's shelves, an orb; Lidamorrutu's gems,
    Lindormi's emblems;
  - the campfire to the south: other Timerunners, veterans of this war from their own hours after it,
    a cook; Nostwin's snacks, Erus's scrap;
  - and between them porters on their rounds, wardens walking the edge, whelps underfoot.

Legion Remix's Bazaar cast (the Bronze vendors, Metros, Nedward) are wrath_remix_world_0009_bronze.sql's
creatures, placed there (STORY_SPOTS keeps their spots); their stalls and lines are here.

Everyone with something to say says it now and then while a Timerunner is about, to the air or to
someone near them (src/RemixBazaar.cpp). Positions are the world's (x north, y west); heights are
the floor's, from data/bazaar_ground.tsv (`.remix ground` on the realm, a reading every two
yards), so nothing floats or sinks.
