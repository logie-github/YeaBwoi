/*
 * The opening (WrathRemix.Intro, STORY.md): a new Timerunner is a veteran of the war against the
 * Lich King, some time after his fall, drinking with three friends in their faction's tavern (the
 * Gilded Rose in Stormwind, the Broken Tusk in Orgrimmar). They toast the Frozen Throne, remember
 * the Wrathgate and Ulduar, and drink to the one of them who didn't come home from Icecrown. Then
 * the room stops, mid-toast, and Moratari walks in: "I'm sorry, hero. I need you."
 *
 * She takes them back into the war's last battle, at the Broken Front in Icecrown: Tirion and the
 * Argent Crusade, the Scourge pouring out of the snow, the Lich King himself, until time stops
 * under Frostmourne. Then through what his reign cost, three moments she holds still for them: the
 * Wrathgate after the plague, Wintergarde under Naxxramas, Icecrown's fields where the val'kyr
 * raise the fallen. "We can stop all of this. We can undo it." And on to the Infinite Bazaar,
 * years earlier, where Eternus explains.
 *
 * It is the Timerunner's alone: a phase of its own (no one else there, none of the places' own
 * creatures), everyone in it summoned for them. Each act's steps belong to it: they start once the
 * Timerunner has arrived (a far journey keeps them on a loading screen a while), and a step of an
 * act that is over does nothing. In the battle they are the hero they were, the Light's wings on
 * them; nothing can hurt them, and the dead fall to them in a blow or three. Once seen it is not
 * seen again (remix_character.intro); one cut short (a logout, a crash: wherever it left them)
 * plays again from the tavern at the next login. Death knights, who have Acherus, and the realm's
 * bots don't have it. `.remix intro` plays it for a game master, `.remix intro skip` ends it.
 *
 * Each act opens from the dark: the app's add-on (TouchAddon.kt) holds a curtain over the screen,
 * with where and when the act is written on it, from the moment the Timerunner is sent there (a
 * new one's from before their first loading screen ends) until the game has finished loading the
 * place (its frames run smoothly again: the add-on says "settled"), and then lifts it over a few
 * seconds as the act begins. A phone loads a city or a battlefield choppily for a while; none of
 * that is seen. Without the add-on (CI's test client answers the curtain at once) an act waits
 * WrathRemix.Intro.SettleSeconds at most.
