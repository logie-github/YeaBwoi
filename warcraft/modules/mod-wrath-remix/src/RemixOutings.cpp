/*
 * Wrath Remix: outings (remix_outing). Somewhere Moratari takes the Timerunner (an evening in
 * Dalaran, her tent at the Bazaar, a flight on her back): they go there, in a phase of its own when
 * it's private (her tent: no one else is in it), with their gear unseen when it says so (it's only
 * looks: nothing comes off), a scene plays (remix_scene); then their gear is seen again, the world's
 * phase is theirs again, and they're back where they were, and she at her post.
 *
 * Never from a dungeon, a raid, a battleground, a boat or a vehicle (nowhere to come back to). One
 * left by going somewhere else (a hearthstone, a summons, a death's release) ends where they go,
 * without taking them back; one left by logging out is saved where it began.
 *
 * A flight is a taxi ride on her (her dragon shape is the mount) from one of the game's flight
 * points to another, her words on the way (remix_outing_line), then back.
 *
 * The screen's fade (a scene's ACT_FADE) is the app's add-on's: an add-on message to the player
 * ("WowRemix<tab>fade <milliseconds> <words>"), and the words in chat as well.
