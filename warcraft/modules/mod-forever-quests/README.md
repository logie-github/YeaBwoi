# mod-forever-quests: WoW: Forever's quests

WoW: Forever's new quests in the old zones, on ChromieCraft's realm only: 123 of Forever's 889 new
quests (ids 86000 and up that the core hasn't), in Forever's own words, with the 91 new people
and creatures they need. Forever's new zones and dungeons aren't here (the user: "don't worry about
the new zone ones").

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Realm | ChromieCraft (`ctl.sh`, `realm_sql`: `data/sql/chromiecraft/world` into `acore_world` alone); Wrath Remix has none of it |
| Ids | Forever's own: quests 86574 to 99158, NPCs 209797 to 276099, items 247826 to 286355; the new NPCs' spawns are guids 8600000 and up |
| Races | Forever's race masks: an Alliance quest is every Alliance race's, the Draenei's, void elves' and Lightforged's included; a race the realm adds goes with the race whose start it takes (the Skyborne of the High Order with the Humans, the Windshapers and Zandalari with the Tauren, the nightborne and blood elves with the Forsaken, the void elves, Lightforged and Draenei with the Night Elves) |

## The new people and creatures

Forever's NPCs that 3.3.5 hasn't stand where Forever has them (QuestieDB's spots on the zone's map,
put on the world by 3.3.5's WorldMapArea; on the ground there, from the server's map files the way
the core reads them, or at the height of the core's own spawns close by where those stand inside a
building), one spot for a quest giver or a named creature, up to 40 for the rest. 3.3.5 has none
of their models, so each is drawn as the core's creature nearest it in kind (the user: "use
whatever model you think"):

- the same type, and family for beasts (Wowhead's tooltip: Beast, Spider; Humanoid);
- for people, someone of the same side (friendly to the Alliance, the Horde or both, by the faction
  and its standing as the core reacts to a player), unless named for the same kind of creature (an
  Abomination);
- the most name words shared ("Dragonmaw Infiltrator" is drawn as a Dragonmaw Raider), a quest
  giver as one of the core's quest givers;
- then the nearest spawn to where it stands, one of the old world's before Outland's and
  Northrend's, the nearest level. Never a holiday's creature, a spirit healer or an invisible
  trigger.

It takes that creature's look, equipment and fighting numbers (and its loot, as its own), under its
own name, title, level and rank (an elite three times its look's health, where that isn't one), and its own side: a quest
giver is on its quests' side where the data has none, a creature to kill or loot is no friend of
the side its quests are for. The table below names each one's look.

"Money estimated": Wowhead's data has no rewards for the quest (no money or experience), so its
money is the median of what the core's quests of the same level and experience pay.
"Experience estimated": wow4ever.quest hasn't it either, so it's the 3.3.5 step for a quest of its
kind (a delivery 2, a quest with objectives 5). "Hand-in text made up": Wowhead's data has none, so
it's "Hand in the quest." (the user: "just make something simple up").

## Where everything comes from

- **Which quests, who gives and ends them, objectives, item sources, prerequisites, races, levels,
  the new NPCs' spots**: [QuestieDB](https://github.com/Questie/QuestieDB)'s Forever database
  (`data/Forever` and its Forever corrections: the generated delta-base, traces and authored fixes,
  in its own order), read as data by `tools/lualit.py` and `tools/questiedb.py` (no Lua is run).
- **The words, objectives' counts, rewards, money, experience, reputation**: each quest's page on
  [foreverchanges.pro](https://foreverchanges.pro/quests) (Wowhead's Forever database as the site
  shows it; beta client 1.60.1.70532), read by `tools/foreverchanges.py`. Wowhead itself turns
  away scripted reading of its pages. Quest text © Blizzard Entertainment.
- **Experience the page hasn't**: wow4ever.quest's pages (`data/forever/experience.json`).
- **The new NPCs' type, family and rank, the new rewards' stats, damage, armor and effects**:
  Wowhead's tooltips (`tools/wowhead.py`); the rewards' class, slot, binding, prices and levels:
  the Forever client's Item and ItemSparse tables (wago.tools). Equip lines 3.3.5 can carry as a
  stat (spell damage and healing is 3.3.5's spell power) are stats; the others (Forever's "+2%
  movement speed in Silverpine") aren't kept. A reward whose use is a spell 3.3.5 hasn't (Forever's
  profession books) isn't given (`report.json`, `rewards_left_out`).
- **Looks of the new items**: the 3.3.5 item display with the same icon (ItemDisplayInfo.dbc), the
  one the core's items of the same slot use first; a quest item whose icon 3.3.5 hasn't looks like
  the core's quest item with the nearest name.
- **Drop chances**: not in any source. A quest item drops at 60% from one or two kinds of creature
  and 35% from more; an item that starts a quest drops for anyone who hasn't taken it, always from
  a single creature, 8% from several.

## What isn't here, and why

`data/forever/report.json` lists every other new quest with its reasons. In short:

- **New zones and dungeons**: Zephras Isle, Shen'dralas, Riverglades, the Darkspear Islands, the
  Hall of Thanes, the Ruins of Lordaeron, Excavation Site: Wetlands, the City of Dalaran.
- **Items no creature drops in the data** (from objects, from people's hands, from what QuestieDB
  hasn't recorded), quests whose ender or starter the data lacks, people with no spot in the old
  zones in the data (QuestieDB holds back the new spawns in Redridge, the Eastern Plaguelands,
  Mulgore and Stormwind, whose maps Forever redrew).
- **Scripts**: places to explore, spells to cast, objects to use, kill credit, events, duels.
- **Class quests** (3.3.5's class training has its own), **Crafting** (Craftsman's Writs),
  **Camping** (Forever's profession), Forever's fishing contest, holidays and invasions.

    python3 tools/forever.py import QUESTIEDB_DIR WORLD_SQL_DIR SERVER_DATA_DIR CACHE_DIR
    python3 tools/forever.py build SERVER_DATA_DIR WORLD_SQL_DIR

`import` picks the quests and writes `data/forever/quests.json` and `report.json` (fetching the
quests' pages, the tooltips and the client's tables into CACHE_DIR, kept between runs); `build`
writes `data/sql/chromiecraft/world/forever_quests.sql` (quests, their givers and enders, the new
NPCs, their looks and spawns, items, drops; safe to run again). WORLD_SQL_DIR: the core's
`data/sql/base/db_world` at the realm's commit (`warcraft/server-version.env`); SERVER_DATA_DIR:
the server data's `dbc` and `maps` (`warcraft/server-data.env`). Both outputs are committed.

## Tests

- `tools/test_forever.py` (CI): the page reader on a stand-in page; the tooltip reader on stand-in
  tooltips; the races each Forever race mask opens; the committed SQL against its data (each
  quest's words, a giver, an ender, every new item it names made, every new NPC drawn and
  standing somewhere).
- Checked here: the SQL in MariaDB 10.11 on the core's base world tables, applied twice; there,
  every quest's giver, ender and creature to kill stands somewhere, every item to collect drops
  from something, every new NPC has a look. The height reader against the core's own spawns: 79%
  within a yard of the ground it gives (the rest stand in buildings, caves and water).
- CI's server test: all the quests and new NPCs in ChromieCraft's world, none in Remix's, and not
  a word from the world server about any of them.
- Not checked: playing them; how the new NPCs look and stand in the game.
