-- The void elves, nightborne, Lightforged Draenei and Zandalari Trolls (mod-allied-races) on the character creation and selection
-- screens. Loaded after the game's own screens (the patch adds it to GlueXML.toc), before
-- mod-skyborne's SkyborneCreate.lua when that patch is in (it reads this one's archive):
--
--  * More race buttons: the game's screen has ten (CharacterCreateRaceButton1-10);
--    AlliedRacesCreate.xml makes six more, here given the names the screen looks for, where it
--    hasn't a button by that number already (another patch's screen may have more).
--  * Where they go: after the screen lays out its races, each side's in two columns (the
--    Alliance's left, the Horde's right), two to a row from the top (the Skyborne's screen lays
--    them out the same way, after this).
--  * Their icons: their portraits in the free columns of the race icons (the patch paints them
--    there: data/client/icons).
--  * Their backgrounds: the void elves' and the Lightforged's are the Draenei's (they start in Ammen
--    Vale), the Zandalari's the Tauren's (Camp Narache), the nightborne's the Night Elves'. Each
--    scene's camera is framed for its own race's height: the Forsaken's, for the shorter, stooped
--    undead, cut off the nightborne's head (a night elf's height); the Night Elves' fits them.
--  * Their text.
