"""The character creation screen's tables checked for every look it can step to: a client's tables
as the game reads them (every patch in), each race and sex with player looks, each slider.

    python3 tools/check_looks.py DBC_DIR

DBC_DIR: CharSections, CharHairGeosets, CharacterFacialHairStyles, ChrRaces, CreatureDisplayInfo
and CreatureModelData (.dbc) out of the client's patch chain. The screen counts a slider's
choices from the rows it finds and then looks up the row for the choice and the skin colour; a
choice with no row for one colour is what crashed it (crash report #34: skins with
the player faces of their race but not the death knights'). So, for each race and sex with player looks (the player's rows, flag 1), as the game's own tables
are laid out (a death knight's skins, flag 4 with 1, carry the death knights' faces alone; the
colours between are the NPCs'):

  * every player skin colour that isn't a death knight's has the same faces as the others, and
    every death knight's skin the same as the other death knights';
  * every player skin colour has its underwear where the race has any;
  * the table is in the game's order: each race, sex, section and variation one run of rows (the
    game builds its look-up from the runs: crash reports #34 to #54);
  * no skin colour below the highest has no row at all (an NPC's will do, as the game's own are):
    the screen reads a colour's row by its number as the race changes;
  * every hair style has the same hair colours, and its row in CharHairGeosets;
  * every facial hair texture style has the same colours;
  * CharacterFacialHairStyles has the features 0 to n-1;
  * the race's two looks (ChrRaces) have their display and model rows.

Prints each problem and exits 1 if there is one.
