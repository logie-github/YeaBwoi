"""Makes mod-brill-home's world SQL (data/sql/chromiecraft/world/brill_home_world.sql): the house in
Brill, its furniture, Cedric Harrow, Jamie Nore's part and the quests, Corn the dog, and Carolai Anise's
quests (her keepsakes: her locket at Solliden Farmstead, a lily on Brightwater Lake's shore).

The house is the farmhouse Brill's own houses are (Duskwood_Human_Farm.wmo, the game's display 7432),
as a gameobject of the kind the game's own buildings out in the world are (a destructible building,
never damaged: Light's Point Tower's). Where it stands (the user, after four places: "The best place you
think that doesn't look stupid and looks like a natural place to put it"), found from the server's data
(data.zip: the terrain's heights, the world's models; the guards' paths for the roads; every spawn),
searching Brill for the ground that holds the whole model level, beside a road, its door onto it:
- (2275.0, 480.5), map 56.5, 51.9: beside the road north out of Brill, 15 yards off it, nothing within the
  model's 19 by 18 yards (the builder's yard of the Community Projects moved for it);
- turned 290 degrees: its doorway (the model's own side at 257.5 degrees) faces the road, south;
- its base 29.96 high: the floor (4.1 above the base) 0.2 above the highest ground under it; the ground
  under it is level to 0.4 yards and the doorstep 0.25 above the ground outside, as Brill's own farmhouse
  stands.

Everything inside is placed in the house's own coordinates (yards from its middle, the doorway's side
at -y) and turned with it. Run it after changing the layout; the output is committed.
