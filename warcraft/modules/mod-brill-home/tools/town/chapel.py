"""The Forgotten Shadow Chapel (a Community Project, opened by Brill Endures: tools/town/endures.py).

Dark Cleric Mirelle Vane comes from the Undercity to find a growing Brill with no place for reflection, and
asks for the old meeting house past the cemetery: the villagers sheltered there in the plague and scratched
their names into its walls. Brother Halden Wick, once a bellringer, wants four honest walls rather than a
monument; Acolyte Corven Dusk, newly woken, wonders whether the teachings are a door or a nicer name for the
wall; Elsbeth Vale, a widow still attached to the Light, stands at her husband's grave every evening. Five
quests: the meeting house inspected and cleared; stone, timber and its doors; the Book of Names (the choice:
Willem Vale's name added to the wall of names, or the wall kept as the sheltered left it); a walk through the
teachings with Corven (his question answered three ways); the hidden bell found, mended and rung at the
opening. Then the chapel stands (DuskwoodChapel), with Mirelle training priests, Corven selling candles and
reagents, Halden keeping the memorial and selling the house's chapel set, the Names to Remember daily, and
an evening gathering (Elsbeth; Mercy Hollin and Edith Fairweather if the gravekeeper's line brought them to
Brill; Edmund Rook of the library, if it's open). Mirelle visits the Surgeon's Hall in the evenings once it's
open.

The site: north of the cemetery, the chapel's door toward the town centre (its frame below: the chapel's
own coordinates; the meeting house, a burnt farmhouse, stands in its nave until the chapel opens). The
footprints and floors are the models' own (the vmaps' collision): the chapel's floor is 1.9 above its
origin, the meeting house has no floor (its ground is the terrain's). Heights are the terrain's (map tile
0002731) or, out in Tirisfal, those of the game's own spawns beside them.
