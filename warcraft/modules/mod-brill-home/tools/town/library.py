"""The Reclamation Library (a Community Project, opened by Brill Endures: tools/town/endures.py).

Edmund Rook, once a tutor in a house with a library, writes everything down because he's afraid of
forgetting the rest; he has forty-one books in crates in the inn's stable and wants the old customs office
on Stillhome Lane (the lane between it and Apothecary Johaan's house, on Brill's west edge) for a library.
Maela Quill, a census clerk in life, keeps the records and can't abide a wrong date; Tobias Wren binds books
and writes poems in the margins; Nora Bell comes looking for her family. Five quests: the office, its
flooded cellar and the books left at Garren's Haunt; shelves (hardwood from the dead oaks west of town,
Rudd Carver's hinges, Abigail Shiel's parchment); the census of a Lordaeron street whose people now live in
Brill without knowing it (Thomas Arlento and Mrs. Winters were neighbours as children: their greetings
change); the Cinderford chronicle taken back from the Scarlet Crusade's collectors at Solliden Farmstead;
the opening (the player donates one of three things: a child's slate, a plague-year crown, the herald's
broadsheet about the Andorhal grain). Then the library stands (Duskwood_HumanTwoStory), with Edmund's Lost
Pages daily, Maela's growing collection (her options grow with the other questlines finished), Tobias's
writing supplies and the house's library set, Nora at the reading tables, readers by day. Edmund reads at
the chapel in the evenings and collects records at the caravan office by day once they're open.

The site: Brill's west edge, the library's door toward the town centre, clear of Johaan's yard (its frame
below: the library's own coordinates; the customs office, a burnt farmhouse, stands in it until the library
opens). The library's floor is 0.5 below its origin (the vmaps' collision); the office has no floor (the
terrain's, flat here at 35.2). Out in Tirisfal the heights are those of the game's own spawns beside them.
