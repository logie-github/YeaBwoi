"""The Old Brewery (a Community Project, opened by Brill Endures: tools/town/endures.py): Brewmaster Oren
Blackbarrel, who brewed in Brill before the plague, brings his family's brewhouse beside the Gallows' End back to
work, with Calla Fenn (a sarcastic apprentice with a gift for fungal cultures), Bram Lusk (a cooper with no barrels
to make since the plague) and Marta Greaves (the Wayfarer's Rest's innkeeper, who argues with Oren over prices).

Five quests: the brewhouse cleared, its rats killed and Oren's ledger found (his father's ale in it); the copper,
staves and hoops for the vats and the first casks; three experimental batches and three tasters (a choice: the
recipe Oren refines); the spoiled batch (no saboteur: a rot in the cellar's walls); the opening (a choice: the
signature drink's name: Gravemalt Stout, Lordaeron Reserve or Blackroot Bitter). Then the weekly Brewer's Special,
and the house's barrel stand and drinks cabinet.

The town changes a stage at a time (tools/town/README.md, "Projects"): the boarded brewhouse (a closed Duskwood
farmhouse) and Oren at its door (1); barriers, Bram's cooperage (2); the vats, the furnace and shelves in the yard,
the chimney smoking by day (3); the tasting counter, the beer garden and a pavilion over Calla's tubs (4); the cellar's vent and
racks, sample barrels at the market (5); the brewhouse open (the farmhouse, its counter and kegs), its people's day,
Oren's deliveries to the Gallows' End and his quarrels at the caravan office (6); the house's furnishings (7).

The brewhouse stands at (2217, 278) turned 25 degrees, its door toward the road and the Gallows' End, its floor
36.08; its yard's heights are the terrain's (map tile 0002731). Marta stands at the Wayfarer's Rest's door, the
caravan office's building (tools/town/caravan.py), in her tent until it's built."""
