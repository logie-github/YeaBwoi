"""The Last Customer: Ambrose Wicke, a Forsaken shopkeeper whose stall stands behind Brill's town hall
(east of it, on open ground clear of the town's own people and the tournament's "[DND] TAR Pedestal"
rows), won't sell a thing while an order placed before the plague is uncollected: a pair of silvered
candlesticks Tobias Balnir paid for, for his wedding to Marian Hale. The player cleans the stall, reads
the order, finds the Balnir Farmstead (south-east of Brill: the burnt farmhouse, the family plot and its
open grave) and the one Balnir left, Agnes, Tobias's sister: she was in service in Silverpine when the
plague came, died there later and rose, and now washes shrouds at the Sepulcher (a Horde town of levels
10 to 20, as the line is). Her letter leaves the candlesticks to the player: lit in Ambrose's window, or
sold to the next couple who'll have them. Ambrose opens the stall again (the phase "open": his goods out)
and sells odd, cheap things, cheerful and morbid about his new customers.
