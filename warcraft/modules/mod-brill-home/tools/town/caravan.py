"""The Caravan Office (a Community Project, opened by Brill Endures: tools/town/endures.py): Quartermaster Irena
Sable, sent from the Undercity's supply office, builds Brill a loading yard, a warehouse and an office on the
Undercity road, with Dren Hollow (a driver), Garth Molt (a Deathguard given to the roads) and Selwyn Price (a
cheerful trader who buys anything, and who sold a Brill wagon's route to a bandit to pay a debt).

Five quests: the road's complaints and the site marked; the yard's crates, winch and platform; the missing
manifest (the bandit Bartle Kemp's camp on the hill west of the road, and a choice: Selwyn exposed to the
Merchants' Exchange, or let repay it under Irena's eye); the trading agreements, the guards and the first route
(a choice: the Undercity or Silverpine first); the first departure (the wagon loaded, the road cleared, the
receipt signed at the crossroads) and the office opened. Then a daily delivery contract, a traveller's wish to
stay (Wenna Dask, at the Wayfarer's Rest) and the house's delivery (its furniture).

The town changes a stage at a time (tools/town/README.md, "Projects"): Irena's field desk by the road and the
drivers' stalled wagons (1); survey stakes and Dren's wagon (2); the yard's warehouse (the Redridge stable),
its dock and crates (3); the office (a Redridge farmhouse) and its counter, maps and records (4); the route
signs, the noticeboard, the guards (5); the office open, the Wayfarer's Rest (a Westfall farmhouse) beside it,
the scheduled caravans (the Undercity's by day, Silverpine's in the evening), the yard's day (6); the house's
furniture (7). Marta Greaves, the Rest's innkeeper, is the brewery's (tools/town/brewery.py): she keeps a tent
on the Rest's ground until it's built.

The site (the terrain's heights, map tile 0002731): the warehouse at (2172, 261) turned 310 degrees, its open end
toward the road; the office at (2186, 282) turned 45, its floor 42.1; the Rest at (2198, 300) turned 30, its
floor 36.49; the yard between them and the road."""
