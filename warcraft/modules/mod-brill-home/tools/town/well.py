"""Something in the Water: five quests from Maudie Fenwick, Brill's laundress, whose cistern water has turned foul
even by Forsaken standards. Junior Apothecary Holland finds a parasite in the samples; its runoff leads west to
the dry drainage channel under the covered bridge on the Deathknell road, where a broodmother has nested; a
split Royal Apothecary Society cask in the nest (a failed growth tincture, "disposed of by dilution") fed it.
Brill has no well: the town draws from a cistern by the town hall, a great barrel fed from the roofs (a model
the zone uses itself: Innbarrel), everyone's, drawn from once it's cleansed; Maudie's
washing comes back beside it (the "restored" phase). Acknowledges the apprentice's line where it fits."""
