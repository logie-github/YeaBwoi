"""The Surgeon's Hall (a Community Project, opened by Brill Endures): Surgeon Elspeth Rane, a Lordaeron
physician dead nine years, comes up the Undercity road with three injured travellers and finds a town of
the dead with nobody to mend them. A vacant farmhouse inside the cemetery's fence, by Junior Apothecary
Holland's gate, becomes the hall: first a treatment tent in its yard, then an examination room in the open
air, Timm Vetch's prosthetic arm (an apprentice who lost his own long after he died), the Royal
Apothecary Society's request to try its remedies on her patients (the player writes the charter: no
research at all, or only with a patient's free word and under her eye; the rewards are the same, the
words and Fenwick's stock follow), and the hall's first operation, on Agnes Morrow's leg. When Agnes walks
out of the ward, the hall opens: the farmhouse restored (the game's RedRidge_human_farm), its ward,
examination table and Timm's workbench inside, Fenwick Pike's wares and first aid taught as Nurse Neela
teaches it.

The hall stands at (2324, 376), its doorway toward the town's middle (2275, 330): turned 325.7 degrees,
the model's own doorway at 257.5 degrees from that (as the house's is). Its base is 30.29 high, the floor
(4.1 above the base) 0.2 above the highest ground under it, so things inside stand at 34.39. Outside, the
heights are the game's terrain's (map tile 0002731). The vacant farmhouse (the same building closed up)
stands there until the hall opens.

Stages (every project's): 1 open, 2 to 5 as each quest is done, 6 open, 7 the house's furnishings bought.
Daily life once it's open: Elspeth at the door; Fenwick at his counter and Timm at his bench; a patient in the
ward by day and another by night; Agnes Morrow in the yard by day and in the square of an evening; the
Society's apothecary of a morning; Carolai Anise with her basket of an evening.
