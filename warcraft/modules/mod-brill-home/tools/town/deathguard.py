"""A Deathguard's Duty: five quests for Deathguard Dillinger (1496), the senior Deathguard on Brill's north
road. The watch is short-handed and Deathguard Harlan has been missing his patrols; the player carries the
watch's supplies, clears the north road and follows his tracks west to Solliden Farmstead, where Harlan,
a farmhand there in life, stands in the trees watching the cottage where his living wife Maren and their
daughter Lise still live. He can't go to them. The player helps him choose: back to his old post on the
north road (phase "returned") or a post at the cemetery, his back to the west (phase "reassigned"). Before
the choice he isn't in Brill; on the hill above Solliden he's there for everyone (outside Brill, where the
town's phases don't reach), and says what his choice became.

The player's dog, Corn (DOG) is noticed along the way, never needed."""
