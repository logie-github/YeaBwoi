"""Beneath the Gallows (Brill: A Place Among the Forsaken; tools/town/README.md): the one hidden line.

It opens only from a discovery in another line: the bricked-up wall with the Cult's mark behind the player's
cellar (the house's "Beneath the Floorboards") or Gideon Hale's tale of the passage he walled up beneath the
cemetery (the end of The Gravekeeper's Ledger, tools/town/grave.py). Until then its giver, Deathstalker Isolde
Ashcroft by Brill's mausoleum, and the marks she sends the player to are in a phase ("unlocked") the player isn't in.

In the plague year Aldric Croft, Brill's generous benefactor and a necromancer of the Cult of the Damned, offered the
town a refuge in the old tunnels between Brill and the Agamand family vaults, walled its ways in, and raised those
who sheltered there. He's in the Agamand Family Crypt still (north of Brill, reached on foot), waiting for a Lich King
who stopped answering him years ago. Five quests: the Cult's marks beneath Brill; the refugees' journals in the crypt;
the bound guardians; Croft himself, through his door and his unsent letters; and Croft killed, his roll of the raised
taken to the gravekeeper. The crypt (outside Brill) is everyone's: its guardians and Croft are there for all.

Its result: the gravekeeper's greetings (grave.py), Gideon's, and a relic for the house: Croft's skull-candle, snuffed,
in the house of a player who owns it (the phase "relic").
