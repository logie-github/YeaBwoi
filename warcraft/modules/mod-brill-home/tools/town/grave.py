"""The Gravekeeper's Ledger (Brill: A Place Among the Forsaken; tools/town/README.md).

Mortimer Weller, Brill's new gravekeeper (the parish clerk in life, who wrote the plague year's burials), finds
graves emptied with no sign of the Scourge. The names written twice in his ledger are the dead the Deathguard
put down and buried a second time; some of them have woken with their own minds, and the first to wake has been
digging the others out. Five quests: the ledger and five graves; the evidence in three opened graves; the trail
to an abandoned mausoleum east of town and the four hiding there (Mercy Hollin, Gideon Hale, Edith Fairweather,
Walter Shaw); their things from their old homes, and a choice: walk into Brill by daylight under their own names,
or come in quietly with the gravekeeper's word; the Magistrate's rolls and the last bell.

Its result: the four live in Brill (the phase "newcomers", their greetings by the choice), the gravekeeper's
greetings change with this line and Beneath the Gallows (tools/town/gallows.py), and Gideon's tale of the passage
he bricked up beneath the cemetery opens that line (its phase "unlocked" asks R:grave.bell).
