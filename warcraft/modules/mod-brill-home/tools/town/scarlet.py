"""Whispers of the Scarlet: five quests for Magistrate Sevren (1499). The Scarlet Crusade knows Brill's
patrols; the letters its couriers burn when caught lead to Lowell Marsh, Brill's lamplighter, who walks
the streets with the night watch and has been writing their hours down for a Scarlet priest, Brother
Anselm, who promised to make him alive again. The player decides his fate: exposed to Sevren (taken
away), persuaded to give it up (he stays and lights the lamps), or let go down the west road (gone; now
and then a letter from him waits at the inn). His fate changes what Sevren, the inn and a few of the
Deathguard say.

Phase (one): "informant": Lowell Marsh is in Brill for everyone who hasn't had him taken away or let him
go. Choices are marks: exposed, spared, escaped."""
